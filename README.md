Intergalactic FM
________________

Intergalactic FM is the follow-up to the Cybernetic Broadcasting System, an internet radio station, interstellar beacon and an extraterrestrial forum operating from June 2002 to early 2008. In its five year existence, CBS transmitted only the finest electronic sounds, communicated with countless alien life forms and gave a warm resting place to lost robots from all over the galaxy. But when a nearby star went supernova CBS was caught in the blast and obliterated. Late 2008, from the ashes of the Cybernetic Broadcasting System, Intergalactic FM emerged, hosting several radio streams, TV stations and an endless supply of DJ mixes for downloading and sharing.
